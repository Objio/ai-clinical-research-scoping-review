General overview</a>\n","\n","<p style='text-align: justify;'>\n","<i>Cistus</i> is a genus of angiosperm plants of the cistaceae family, known as jaras, jaguarzos or steppes. They usually form part, sometimes important, of the Mediterranean garrigue, and some species behave as pioneers in the recovery of degraded soils. They are pyrophilic, their germination is favored by fire, and recurrent fires help their permanence by eliminating competition from other plants that would end up displacing them from the biotopes. Several plants of the <i>Cistus</i> genus, such as <i>Cistus salviifolius</i>, <i>Cistus ladanifer</i>, or <i>Cistus albidus</i>, among others, have been extensively studied in recent years due to their molecular composition and biological activity. Plants of the <i>Cistus</i> genus have been shown to possess antioxidant, antimicrobial, antitumor or metabolic syndrome regulatory capacity, among others.\n","<br><br>To the best of our knowledge, there is no literature review on the properties of plants of the <i>Cistus</i> genus made through the use of artificial intelligence applied to language processing.\n","<br><br><b>The aim of this study:</b>\n","<br>To analyze Scopus abstracts in order to highlight the various topics of <i>Cistus</i> research, going deeper into those related to its biological activity.<br>\n","<br><b>The specific aims are:</b>\n","<br>To use K-mean technique in order to categorize groups of research articles. This will allow to explore whether the information used in Scopus abstracts reflects the key concepts and the current understanding of <i>Cistus</i> uses.<br>\n","<br>To observe the trends of <i>Cistus</i> research over the past years based on Scopus abstracts of papers related to <i>Cistus</i>, which would indicate general trends of research efforts.\n","</p>"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"wRsFp0e2L27K"},"source":["[Back to top](#0)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":3,"metadata":{"id":"TRj7ZZYE6Ueu","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1762205966903,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":45,"user":{"displayName":"Gilberto Objío Subero","userId":"05492795578433095484"}}},"outputs":[],"source":["#@title <b><font color=\"blue\" size=\"+2\">Configuring the system...\n","%%capture\n","from io import StringIO\n","import sys\n","\n","class Capturing(list):\n","    def __enter__(self):\n","        self._stdout = sys.stdout\n","        sys.stdout = self._stringio = StringIO()\n","        return self\n","    def __exit__(self, *args):\n","        self.extend(self._stringio.getvalue().splitlines())\n","        del self._stringio    # free up some memory\n","        sys.stdout = self._stdout"]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from google.colab import drive\n","drive.mount('/content/drive')"],"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"id":"PNog0170_zv_","executionInfo":{"status":"ok","timestamp":1762205992178,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":25270,"user":{"displayName":"Gilberto Objío Subero","userId":"05492795578433095484"}},"outputId":"1ab63f87-0b3f-407a-b834-8cd9152e4dcc"},"execution_count":4,"outputs":[{"output_type":"stream","name":"stdout","text":["Mounted at /content/drive\n"]}]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"wFiNFBaaL27K"},"source":["# <a id='2' style=color:black>2.

This suggests a continued and perhaps growing interest in the overarching applications and infrastructure of AI within the healthcare domain.\n","\n","*   **Cluster 1 (Predict, Model, Radiom, Valid, Risk, Auc, Clinic, Features, Machine, Learn, Perform, External, Develop, Set):** This cluster, focused on predictive modeling, risk assessment, and performance evaluation using machine learning techniques, appears to have a consistent presence and may be slightly increasing. This indicates ongoing research in developing and validating AI models for various clinical predictions and assessments.\n","\n","*   **Cluster 2 (Drug, Discovery, Development, Pharmaceut, Clinic, Target, Predict, Compound, Disease, Repurpos, Learn, Intellig, Therapeut, Artificial):** This cluster, centered around drug discovery, development, and therapeutic applications of AI, shows a relatively lower but noticeable proportion of articles. Its trend appears somewhat stable in the analyzed period. This suggests a steady, albeit perhaps not as rapidly growing, research effort in applying AI for pharmaceutical purposes.\n","\n","*   **Cluster 3 (Image, Clinic, Learn, Model, Detect, Disease, Cancer, Deep, Accuraci, Dataset, Predict, Classif, Segment, Features):** This is the largest cluster and is heavily focused on medical imaging, disease detection (particularly cancer), and the use of deep learning for tasks like classification and segmentation. The line plot shows this cluster dominating the research landscape and potentially exhibiting a slight decrease in proportion from 2023 to 2025, although the absolute number of publications might still be increasing. This highlights the significant impact of AI, especially deep learning, in medical imaging analysis.\n","\n","*   **Cluster 4 (Medic, Privaci, Image, Learn, Feder, Generat, Model, Framework, Secur, Healthcare, Dataset, Propos, Preserv, Train):** This cluster includes themes of medical AI with an emphasis on privacy, federated learning, generative models, and secure data handling. Its proportion seems to be increasing over the years. This suggests a growing awareness and research focus on addressing critical issues like data privacy and security, and exploring advanced AI techniques like federative and generative models in clinical settings.\n","\n","**Overall Trends:**\n","\n","The analysis suggests a dynamic research landscape. While medical imaging (Cluster 3) remains a dominant area, there is increasing interest in broader healthcare AI applications (Cluster 0), predictive modeling (Cluster 1), drug discovery (Cluster 2), and importantly, in privacy-preserving and advanced AI techniques (Cluster 4). The relative changes in proportions of these clusters over the years indicate shifts in research priorities and the emergence of new frontiers in applying AI to clinical investigation."]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["from sklearn.metrics import pairwise_distances\n","import joblib\n","\n","# Reload the KMeans model to ensure correct centroids\n","filename = 'finalized_kmean_model.sav'\n","kmeans_results = joblib.load(filename)\n","kmeans_best_result = kmeans_results.get(best_result)\n","\n","\n","# Regenerate TF-IDF vectors - Ensure tf_final is the original one\n","X, tf_final, vectorizer = TfidFun(corpus)\n","\n","# Filter articles belonging to Cluster 3 using the original df_final to get indices\n","cluster_3_indices = df_final[df_final['Cluster'] == 3].index\n","\n","# Get the TF-IDF vectors for Cluster 3 articles using the original tf_final\n","cluster_3_tfidf = tf_final.loc[cluster_3_indices]\n","\n","# Get the centroid of Cluster 3 - Access the centroid directly from the reloaded best_result kmeans model\n","cluster_3_centroid = kmeans_best_result.cluster_centers_[3].reshape(1, -1)\n","\n","# Calculate the Euclidean distance from each article in Cluster 3 to the centroid\n","distances = pairwise_distances(cluster_3_tfidf, cluster_3_centroid, metric='euclidean')\n","\n","# Create a new dataframe for cluster 3 articles to add the distance\n","cluster_3_articles_df = df_final.loc[cluster_3_indices].copy()\n","\n","# Add distances to the dataframe and sort by distance\n","cluster_3_articles_df['Distance_to_Centroid'] = distances\n","most_dominant_articles = cluster_3_articles_df.sort_values(by='Distance_to_Centroid').head(150)\n","\n","# Display the list of the 150 most dominant articles\n","display(most_dominant_articles[['Title', 'Year', 'Abstract', 'Distance_to_Centroid']])"],"metadata":{"id":"oIYCwrrhha1v","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1762206007489,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":40826,"user":{"displayName":"Gilberto Objío Subero","userId":"05492795578433095484"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]},{"cell_type":"code","source":["most_dominant_articles.to_excel('most_dominant_cluster_3_articles.xlsx', index=False)"],"metadata":{"id":"bzcAtCjUh_lt","executionInfo":{"status":"aborted","timestamp":1762206007490,"user_tz":240,"elapsed":40818,"user":{"displayName":"Gilberto Objío Subero","userId":"05492795578433095484"}}},"execution_count":null,"outputs":[]}],"metadata":{"colab":{"provenance":[{"file_id":"1BQJ19Vazt8UhsgmuWebWWQP7j7Ty_IK4","timestamp":1709719422682}],"collapsed_sections":["1GeREn-fL27b","se9D5l9qL27b","WUPrAvwcL27q","yeAzArTtL27q","DmKDV2XLL27t"]},"kernelspec":{"display_name":"Python 3","language":"python","name":"python3"},"language_info":{"codemirror_mode":{"name":"ipython","version":3},"file_extension":".py","mimetype":"text/x-python","name":"python","nbconvert_exporter":"python","pygments_lexer":"ipython3","version":"3.8.10"}},"nbformat":4,"nbformat_minor":0}
